# Canned Response Manager

A simple Python-based desktop application to create, manage, and use canned responses. This app allows you to add, edit, delete, and copy canned responses, making it ideal for support teams or anyone who frequently uses pre-written messages.

---

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, and organize canned responses.
- Save responses persistently in a local JSON file (`responses.json`).
- Copy responses to the clipboard with one click.
- User-friendly GUI built with `Tkinter`.
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, and macOS).

---

## Requirements

### Libraries
The following Python libraries are required:

- `tkinter` (included with Python)
- `json` (included with Python)
- `os` (included with Python)

If you want to bundle the app into an executable, you’ll also need:

- `PyInstaller`

Install PyInstaller using pip:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

---

## Running the App

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohaib1khan/Response_box.git
   cd canned-response-manager
   ```

2. **Run the App**:

   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher):

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

## Bundling the App into an Executable

You can create a standalone executable for the application so it can be run without Python installed.

### Steps to Bundle the App

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the Executable**:
   
   Run the following command to package the app into a single executable file:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py
   or
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=app_icon.ico app.py
   ```

   - `--onefile`: Packages everything into a single file.
   - `--noconsole`: Hides the console window (useful for GUI apps).

3. **Locate the Executable**:

   The executable will be in the `dist/` directory inside your project folder.

   - On Linux: `./dist/app`
   - On Windows: `./dist/app.exe`
   - On macOS: `./dist/app`

4. **Run the Executable**:
   
   ```bash
   ./dist/app
   ```

## Repository Structure

```plaintext
canned-response-manager/
├── app.py         # Main application file
├── responses.json # Local file to store canned responses (auto-created at runtime)
├── dist/          # Directory where the bundled executable will be created (auto-generated by PyInstaller)
└── README.md      # Documentation file
```

---

## Notes

- Make sure to include the `responses.json` file in the same directory as the `app.py` if you want to retain saved responses.
- For cross-platform builds, use tools like Wine (to build Windows executables on Linux) or build directly on the target platform.
